Chris accepted in March 2011 and the band was respawned to spread apocalyptic chanting across the mortal world. Later the same year Isabella Ramare joined the Revenge Prevails sect to demolish eardrums with her four stringed jackhammer. \r\n              <br/>\r\n              In 2012, the three members did their first live shows and also recorded their first demo entitled \"Black Void Injection\" It was released in March 2013 \r\n              <br/>\r\n              In 2013, the demo was released but something was still missing, the three members had visions of a fourth member somewhere in the world that needed to shred with them, and so they invoked Ludvig \"Hlodyr\" Björk one full moon night. He joined and with him and his earthquake summoning device, the band was complete. \r\n              <br/>\r\n              In 2014, it was time to provoke the world, so the four members entered their laboratory of death and recorded their first full-length album entitled \"Dark Trembling Solace\" containing over an hour of menacing eerie hellish messages. The Album was released for mortal ears in 2015. \r\n              <br/>\r\n              In 2015, the four members began constructing a new rehearsal and studio. The Laboratory v.2 - a place to practice their dark art and to record forthcoming devilish musick. It stood complete in 2016 and within these mystic walls, the work for their next massive full-length album was ongoing. \r\n              <br/>\r\n              In 2016, The Laboratory v.2 stood complete and within those mystic walls the work for their next massive full-length album was created and recorded during many months and tiresome tribulations.  \r\n              <br/>\r\n              In 2017, the second full-length album of Revenge Prevails was released! The Revengers choose to call it \"False Hope Cruelty\" A fitting name after so many endeavours surrounding the album. The album was a monument, a monolith so formidable and vicious it shook the bedrock itself! Listen to it at your own risk! \r\n              <br/>\r\n              In 2018, Revenge Prevails rampage like a fierce bull through the landscape of live performance as well as writing new material. At the end of the year, the band had to relocate from their precious Laboratory v.2 to a mysterious cabin within the deep, dark woods in the outskirts of their hometown Uddevalla. Its location is still unknown to everyone but those closest to the bandmembers… \r\n              <br/>\r\n              In 2019, the band took their live show abroad for the first time. Including “Dark Mental Festival” in Denmark as well as Nukstock open air in Germany. During the time within the walls of the mysterious cabin, the bandmembers finished composing their third full-length album. The recording began in November 2019 at Armageddon-Recordings, the studio owned and managed by the mighty Anders “Bloodlord” Backelin.   \r\n              <br/>\r\n              In 2020, the third full-length was completed in February and released later that year. Its name: HABITATS\r\n              This was their most mysterious and haunting release yet. You can feel and taste the deep, dark, woods were the album was composed. The album is their most extreme to date. Like the sea itself, calm and beautiful, but also brutal and without mercy. Listen at your own peril… \r\n              <br/>\r\n              The future is unknown... \r\n            </p>\r\n          </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n      </Container>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Home;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport '../App.css';\r\n\r\nclass About extends React.Component { \r\n  render() {\r\n    return( \r\n      <Container>\r\n        <Row>\r\n          <Col>\r\n            <h1>About</h1>\r\n          </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n      </Container>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Container, Col, Row } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport '../App.css';\r\n\r\nclass Contact extends React.Component { \r\n  render() {\r\n    return( \r\n      <Container>\r\n        <Row>\r\n          <Col>\r\n            <h1>Contact</h1>\r\n          </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n      </Container>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Contact;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport '../App.css';\r\n\r\nclass Gigs extends React.Component { \r\n  render() {\r\n    return( \r\n      <Container>\r\n        <Row>\r\n          <Col>\r\n            <h1>Gigs</h1>\r\n          </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n      </Container>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Gigs;","import React, { Fragment } from 'react';\nimport MyNavbar from './components/mynavbar'\nimport { HashRouter as Router, Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { withRouter } from 'react-router' \nimport Home from './components/home';\nimport About from './components/about'\nimport Contact from './components/contact';\nimport Gigs from './components/gigs';\n\nconst HeaderWithRouter = withRouter(MyNavbar);\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  window.addEventListener(\n    \"scroll\",\n    () => {\n      document.body.style.setProperty(\n        \"--scroll\",\n        window.pageYOffset / (document.body.offsetHeight - window.innerHeight)\n      );\n    },\n    false\n  );\n\n  return (    \n     <Router basename=\"/\">\n       <Fragment>\n          <HeaderWithRouter />\n          <Route exact path=\"/\">\n            <Redirect to=\"/home\" />\n          </Route>\n          <Route exact path=\"/home\" component={ Home } />\n          <Route path=\"/about\" component={ About } />\n          <Route path=\"/contact\" component={ Contact } />\n          <Route path=\"/gigs\" component={Gigs} />\n        </Fragment>\n     </Router>   \n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
